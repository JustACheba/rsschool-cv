## About me
I’m a second-year student of BSUIR. At the university, we are taught only the basics of programming. I would like to develop further in this direction. And this is the main reason why I decided to go to rs school. I quickly learn new information and work well in a team. I'm sure that in these courses I will get a lot of new knowledge and also the necessary experience in writing code.

> Practice is the best of all instructors
